Welcome to Neural Semigroups' documentation!
=============================================

The simplest way to get started is to run an example notebook in `Google Colaboratory`_ --- this notebook contains a lot of commentaries.

To look at more experimental results for different semigroups cardinalities, you can use `Kaggle`_:

* `cardinality 4`_
* `cardinality 5`_
